+ Project summary: In this project, we created a classification engine for enhance the resolution of images. We use one GBM baseline model and 3 improvement method to achieve this goal.

	
**Contribution statement**: 

Peilu Zhang: " I write all the baseline code, including feature.R and superresolution.R for all the models and small changes in test.R and train.R. I shortened the feature extracting time of 1500 pictures to 3 mins, tuned the gbm parameter by cross validation. And I fixed the code of xgboost model."
